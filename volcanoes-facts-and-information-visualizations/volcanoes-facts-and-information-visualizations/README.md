# Project 1: Volcano Facts and Information Visualizations

## Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes volcanoes data from the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP), containing information on over 1,500 volcanoes that erupted during the Holocene period (last ~10,000 years).

## Objectives
- Load and explore the volcanoes dataset.
- Visualize geographic and geological data.
- Identify trends in volcanic activity, eruption frequency, and distribution.

## Dataset
- *Name:* volcanoes.csv
- *Size:* ~1500 rows, 30+ columns
- *Features:* Volcano Name, Country, Elevation, Type, Last Known Eruption, Tectonic Setting, etc.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn

## How to Run
1. Open `Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells in sequence.
3. Analyze the charts and findings produced.

## Sample Insights
- Global distribution of volcanoes by tectonic setting.
- Most active volcanic regions in the Holocene.
- Relationship between volcano elevation and type.
